# Optimization-Methods-for-Economic-Dispatch-of-Thermal-Generating-Units
Economic load dispatch (ELD) is a fundamental aspect of power system operation, aiming to determine the optimal generation schedule of various thermal generating units to meet a specific load demand while minimizing total operating costs. This project delves into the intricacies of ELD by examining three distinct scenarios:

● ELD without loss or limits: This simplified scenario assumes an ideal power system without transmission losses or generator constraints.

● ELD with limits but ignoring losses: This scenario introduces generator constraints, such as minimum and maximum power outputs, while disregarding transmission losses.

● ELD considering both limits and losses: This comprehensive scenario incorporates both generator constraints and transmission losses, reflecting the complexities of real-world power systems.

To effectively address these scenarios, the project focuses on three key aspects:

● Optimization of the cost function: The central objective of ELD is to minimize the total generation cost, which is primarily determined by the fuel consumption of the thermal generating units.

● Finding the B-loss coefficients: B-loss coefficients, also known as bus sensitivity factors, quantify the impact of power generation changes at one bus on the power losses at another bus. These coefficients are crucial for incorporating transmission losses into the ELD problem.

● Power flow solution: Power flow analysis is essential for determining the steady-state operation of the power system and for identifying potential congestion in transmission lines. This analysis provides valuable insights for incorporating generator constraints into the ELD problem. 
By exploring these three scenarios and addressing the aforementioned aspects, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques involved in economic load dispatch.
